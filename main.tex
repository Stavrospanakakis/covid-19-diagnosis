\section{Introduction}
The first novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease cases confirmed at a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China in December 2019 with pneumonia of 
unknown cause.\cite{firstcases} The most common symptoms are fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue while the less common ones are sputum production, 
headache, haemoptysis and diarrhoea.\cite{symptoms}

\textbf{Application of deep learning technique to manage COVID-19 in routine clinical practice using CT images: Results of 10 convolutional neural networks}\cite{firstreview}

They used 10 Convolutional Neural Networks. The network with the best accuracy was ResNet-101\cite{resnet} and the accuracy was 99.51 percent.
The number of COVID-19 patients is 108 (48 female and 60 male) and for non-COVID-19 is 86 (35 female and 51 male). The age of COVID-19 is 50.22 +- 10.85
and of non-COVID-19 is 61.45 +- 15.04. The images converted to grayscale and reviewed by an experianced radiologist.The input layer of the CNNs were replaced
with a new one. The dimension of the last fully connected layer of all networks was set to the number of the classes. All the networks were trained with SGDM 
optimizer, learning rate=0.01 and validation frequency = 5. In each epoch the dataset shuffled. The dataset divided to 80 percent train and 20 percent validation.

\textbf{Automated detection of COVID-19 cases using deep neural networks with X-ray images}\cite{secondreview}

The network they used is DarkCovidNet which is based on Darknet-19\cite{darknet}as a starting point. The dataset that used is "A COVID-19 X-ray image databse" which developed by Cohen JP\cite{dataset1secondreview}. There are not complete metadata at the dataset. The patients that have COVID-19 in the dataset are 125(43 female and 82 male). The average age of 26 of them is 55 years. Another dataset is ChestX-ray8 database which developed by Wang et al.\cite{dataset2secondreview} and was used for normal and pneumonia images. It is used optimizer=Adam, loss function=cross entropy and learning rate=3e-3.The datasets divided to 80 percent train and 20 percent validation. The model outputs evaluated by an expert radiologist. They did it with 2 ways. With binary(covid vs healthy) as well as multi classes (covid vs pneumonia vs health). The accuracy for binary is 98.08 and for multi classes 87.02.
